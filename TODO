Tab-based parsing isn't working, I _think_ because we're pattern matching
against the tab tokens after pattern matching against the space tokens.

So INDENT_S matches before INDENT_T. I think instead we'll need to do

INDENT = \n[\t]*|\n[\s]*

And then process it in a single function that aborts if it's seen one
indentation token indicator and not the other.

I guess we can abuse the process dictionary to check for "token_type" where it
can be set to space or tab or undefined. If it sees space and gets a tab,
explode, and vice versa. Need to be careful around empty newlines, possibly.
