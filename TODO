We are not properly printing dedent tokens when a line is indented and then indented again.

i.e.,.

if foo == bar:
  if zip == zap:
    blah
blarg

becomes

if, foo, ==, bar, :
indent, if, zip, ==, zap, :
indent, indent, blah, dedent, dedent
blarg


I think it should instead be:

if, foo, ==, bar, :
indent, if, zip, ==, zap, :, dedent
indent, indent, blah, dedent, dedent
blarg
